# Revexpend-native
Income - Outcome managing app, which I called "Revexpend" - revenues and expeditures.

I had 1 Revexpend app before, but build with Expo and doesn't have much options to expand. So this is the React Native implementation of that old project.
Also, this is my project trying to build and go for production, not a "homework", so I will cut out some out-of-scope things.
