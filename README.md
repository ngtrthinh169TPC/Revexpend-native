# Revexpend-native

Income - Outcome managing app, which I called "Revexpend" - revenues and expeditures.

This is a simple revenue - expenditure managing tool. REALLY SIMPLE.

I had 1 [Revexpend app](https://github.com/ngtrthinh169TPC/revexpend) before, but build with Expo and doesn't have many options to expand. So this is the React Native implementation of that old project.

Also, this is my project trying to build and go for productions, not a "homework", so I will cut out some out-of-scope things.

# Development instructions
